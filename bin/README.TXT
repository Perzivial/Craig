Introduction

Top down functional design and some implementation has been done for a basic Cityscape program.
Use the existing structure (building blocks) to do some bottom up design and implementation of your own.
 
The goal of this lab is for you to demonstrate that you can define classes,
	create objects, and display graphics via a Java application.

Requirements

* Create a Java graphical application (with a Viewer class, Component class) that displays a cityscape.
* Design at least three classes for elements of the cityscape (e.g., building, window, sun, moon, car, tree)
    * demonstrate good class design (encapsulation)
    * provide configurability through constructors and instance variables (size, color, etc.)
* Create multiple instances of a class with different properties and display in the cityscape.
* Document the class using JavaDoc comments (/** */) as demonstrated in the provided code
* Peer review another student's lab

Extensions

* Define additional classes for additional elements of the cityscape.
* Animate your cityscape (e.g., day and night, lights in windows, moving cars)
* Randomize your cityscape (a different cityscape every time)
* Add more awesome.


Submission

* Submit a pull request in GitHub and submit a link to the request with this assignment.
